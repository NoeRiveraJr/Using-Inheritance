# Using-Inheritance
I used this project to utilize inheritance among classes and to better understand the benefits of using inheritance

Hello, I'm Noe Rivera Jr. This project is used to show how to utilize inheritance while working with multiple classes that may share the same fields, properties, and methods. The project uses a military unit as its premise for the classes. I created a Personnel, Vehicle, Weapons, and Missions base class, along with subclasses that are derived from the base classes. I also took the time to utilize everything I've learned so far from the Microsoft Software and Systems Academy such as for loops, while loops, enums, nested if statments, etc.
